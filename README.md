# Tukra
An Abstract Program Slicing Tool


TUKRA  allows the practical evaluation of abstract program slicing algorithms. It exploits the notions of statement relevancy, semantic data dependences and conditional dependences. The combination of these three notions allows TUKRA to refine traditinal syntax-based program dependence graphs, generating more accurate slices. 

Given a program and an abstract program slicing criterion from end-user as input, TUKRA is able to perform both syntax- and semantics-based intraprocedural slicing of the program w.r.t. the slicing criterion.



The main features of TUKRA are:

It allows to perform syntax-based as well as semantics-based slicing of a program.
Users are free to perform single or any combination of semantic computaions: statement relevancy, semantic data dependences, or conditional dependences.
Easy to integrate new abstract domains.
Easy to use by naive users due to its friendly graphical user interfaces.
It allows the practical evaluation of abstract program slicing algorithms.
